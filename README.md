# Setup
You will first want to set up a Data folder (stored in ````Stormbot.Helpers.Constants.DataFolderDir````). 

After that you will need to create a ````config.json```` and fill it with information in the given json format:
````
{
  "Email"            : "",
  "Password"         : "",

  // only if using audio
  "FfmpegDir"        : "",
  "FfprobeDir"       : "", 
  "SoundcloudApiKey" : "",
  "LivestreamerDir"  : "",
  
  // only if using the twitch bridge
  "TwitchOauth"      : "",
  "TwitchUsername"   : ""
}

````
Compile the bot, have it log in with the details we gave it in ````config.json````.
Then you will want to give it the owner id, stored in ````Stormbot.Helpers.Constants.UserOwner````. You can use the !whoami command to find out your user id.
